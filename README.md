Weir3k
----


Essentially the same as `weir2k.py`, but now set up to run on Python 2 or Python 3, and with a few minor bug fixes in place. As we finish up this program new changes will be here, so that the version Don has and likes can stay intact in weir2k in case he needs it again, and this version with new features that may not complete before my termination will be available, but logically separate.
